# Terms of Service

Effective date: February 21, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of BloxChat (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Eligibility

You must be legally capable of entering into a binding agreement under applicable law to use the Service.

## 2. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

1. Violate any applicable law or regulation.
2. Interfere with, disrupt, or degrade the Service.
3. Attempt unauthorized access to any systems or accounts.
4. Distribute malware, spam, or harmful content through the Service.

## 3. User Content

You are responsible for the content you submit or transmit using the Service. You retain ownership of your content.

## 4. Data Storage and Processing

BloxChat is designed to minimize data collection and does not store personal message content on our servers as part of normal operation. Message content may be processed transiently in memory and in network transit to deliver the Service.

Because we do not store personal message content, we generally cannot retrieve, reproduce, verify, or disclose message content after delivery.

## 5. Third-Party Providers

The Service may rely on third-party infrastructure providers (for example, hosting, networking, observability, or error reporting). Their terms and privacy policies may apply to their services.

## 6. Availability and Changes

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, BloxChat and its operators are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, or data, arising from or related to your use of the Service.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, BloxChat and its operators are also not legally responsible for user-generated content that you may receive through the Service, including its accuracy, legality, or safety.

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless BloxChat and its operators from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 9. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, including for violations of these Terms or to protect the Service and its users.

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Service operator is established, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after updated Terms are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
