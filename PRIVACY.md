# Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 21, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how BloxChat ("we," "us," "our") handles information when you use BloxChat (the "Service").

## 1. Privacy by Design

BloxChat is designed to collect as little data as possible. As part of normal operation, we do not store personal message content on our servers.

## 2. Information We Process

Depending on deployment and configuration, we may process limited technical information, such as:

1. Connection metadata (for example, IP address and timestamps) needed to deliver and secure the Service.
2. Minimal operational logs and error diagnostics used for reliability and abuse prevention.
3. Account identifiers and settings required for authentication and app functionality.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use limited processed information to:

1. Provide, maintain, and secure the Service.
2. Detect abuse and troubleshoot technical issues.
3. Comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Message Content

We do not store personal message content on our servers as part of normal operation. Message content may be handled transiently in memory and in network transit to provide real-time delivery.

As a result, we are generally unable to access, recover, or provide message content after transmission.

## 5. Data Retention

Because we minimize storage, retained data is generally limited to operational, security, and diagnostic records. We retain such records only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer period is required by law.

## 6. Sharing of Information

We do not sell personal information. We may share limited information:

1. With service providers that help us operate the Service, under appropriate contractual safeguards.
2. If required by law, legal process, or valid governmental request.
3. To protect rights, safety, and the security of the Service.

## 7. International Processing

If our providers operate in multiple countries, technical information may be processed in those jurisdictions.

## 8. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or a higher age where required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in violation of applicable law.

## 10. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including rights to access, correction, deletion, or restriction. Contact us to submit a request.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after updates are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.
